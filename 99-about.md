Mona is a full-stack engineer with a background in collegiate gaming and English literature, which means she loves working with languages of all sorts. Her current stack includes PostgreSQL, Python, Django, iOS, and of course, English.

Within this blogging igloo, Mona writes about code, [love](https://medium.com/@hazelynut/why-we-fall-in-butterfly-love-cfdb01474068), [family](https://medium.com/@hazelynut/my-father-4d23672e5a3b), [hiking](https://medium.com/@hazelynut/day-1-all-boys-leave-home-some-day-1f84c805cb5a), and life.

Mona is currently working on [Bra Theory](https://bratheory.com/about/), an empathetic, more mathematical approach to bras. We are working to understand the complexities of the bust with more precision than two variables, so that your bra fits, supports, and complements *you* instead of an industry standard. Read more about it [here](https://bratheory.com/).
