Mona Zhang is a Princeton English major (class of 2012), software engineer ([Switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch_(app))), eSports founder ([of the Collegiate Starleague](www.cstarleague.com)), and bra entrepreneur ([Bra Theory](www.bratheory.com)).

As of December 2019, Mona decided to put Bra Theory on hiatus and start a new chapter (though she has no idea what that is yet).

Within this blog, Mona writes essays on her interests, which include code, gaming, art, and being human.

Mona lives in NYC and enjoys dancing, singing, and writing. She is also the electric bassist and singer of a pre-debut band by the name of black.py (Black Python), which is looking for a mediocre drummer to join the lineup.
