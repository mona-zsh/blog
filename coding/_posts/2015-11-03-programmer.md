There have been a few times in my programming career when I realized, _"I'm finally becoming a real software engineer, and not just someone who writes code."_

While I suspect that these experiences are common to the journeyman programmer, as far as I know, they have not been named.

Since naming things (variables, functions, common human experiences) helps others more easily share abstractions, **I invite you to join me in naming these learning experiences as best as we can.**

<sub>Side note: I am a huge fan of [programming jargon](http://blog.codinghorror.com/new-programming-jargon/), which does a great job of naming things that happen to all of us as programmers (e.g. Pokemon exception handling, Heisenbugs, and more), and I think there is room in this lexicon for more jargon.</sub>

# Naming Experiences of the Journeyman Programmer

1. The **There and back again** experience

	_Alternative names_: Deja Vu

	You open up an old piece of code and realize it needs to be refactored. This is the point in every programmer's career when she encounters the ugly consequences of past code.

	This is a great learning experience because it hammers in what NOT to do. It's especially hard as a beginner programmer to code a solution to a problem when you don't anticipate the ways in which you might extend that feature into solving more problems in the future.

	The first time you encounter this, you will become warier of future-proofing your code. You will also realize that **you are not your code**, and that you can and should make changes to past code without fear.

1. The **It's not you, it's me** experience

	_Alternative names_: This is not the answer you are looking for

	There comes a time when your interface looks completely whacky for no discernible reason, and you __know__ you shouldn't try to Google "UIView is missing" because it won't work.

	This is that moment when you realize whether bug is attributable to one or many causes. If it's a bug that likely has one cause, Google and Stack Overflow is your best friend. When it has more than one, you have more soul-searching to do.

1. The **Anything is possible** experience

	This is a realization that no matter what problem your PM throws at you, you know you can solve it in code.

	When an apprentice programmer begins to solve problems with code, some problems are so daunting that she questions whether it can be solved. Then, as she breaks down the problem and solves it incrementally, she realizes that any problem can be incrementally solved.

	The only question is how much it costs, and whether you solve the problem in a way that allows for future, unthought-of but related problems, to be solved through an extension of the original solution.

1. The *Gentile Force* experience

	Shortly after the "anything is possible" realization, the programmer realizes that one's brute force solution is going to work just fine, but cost more to maintain different use cases.
