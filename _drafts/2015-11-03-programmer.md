I can think of a few points in my programming career where I realized, this is what it means to be a programmer.

Side note: I am a huge fan of [programming jargon](http://blog.codinghorror.com/new-programming-jargon/). A favorite of mine is Pokemon exception handling:

```
try {
}
catch (Exception ex) {
// Gotcha!
}
```

*1. Point of origin*

	This can also probably be called time-travel. I like to think of this as when today, Eskimona encounters the results of Baby Developer Eskimona's work, and realizes something went terribly wrong. This is the hardest lesson to bear.

*1. This is not the answer you are looking for*

	Knowing when an answer is Googleable, and when you need to think about your code, long and hard.

*1. Knowing that you can do anything, in any way*

*1. Knowing when being lazy isn't going to work*
