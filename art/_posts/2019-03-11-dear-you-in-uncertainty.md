[i]For you who realize that you have been living to be someone you are not
For you who don't know what you want
For you who aim to please[/i]

Dear Mona, 

It was a winter dawn, and you were loved. You were born a perfect, little, baby Chinese-American girl. Chubby, 9 lbs. You were quick to guzzle milk like a champion. 

You did your best. You were nicknamed: Guai Guai. Obedient. 

You began to listen to everyone around you. 

You were happy to listen, to serve, to make people happy. 

But listening to others, you never listened to yourself. 

You lost your way, somehow. 

You tried to be who you thought you were supposed to be. 

You were polite. 

You followed the rules. 

You stayed quiet. 

You smiled. 

You didn’t eat too much, because then they would call you fat. 

You didn't yawn when you wanted to, because that wouldn’t be polite. 

You abstained from bathroom breaks, as to not inconvenience the people around you. 

You worked hard to be the best at everything, because if you weren’t, you lost it all. 

You had to be better than everyone 

You had to play by the rules 

You had to be seen as good, pleasant, smart. 

Because who else would you be? 

You didn’t know 

How to breathe 

How to be 

How to move 

as who you were born to be 

You didn’t know who you wanted to be 

You became like everyone else 

And inside, your soul become quiet 

You went under 

The shoulds echoing around in your mind 

Then, one day, 

your body said no 

You hit rock bottom in a way that you still don't understand 

You're not sure if anyone will understand, or be interested in that story, until it drags 
them under, too 

You finally listened 

You lost your mind 

You found your heart 

Your body took over 

You danced at midnight 

When your eyes closed, you saw light 

and you saw darkness 

You saw life and death 

You still think it sounds crazy 

You judge yourself for it 

Maybe you were crazy. Maybe you weren't. Maybe you were just trying to survive. 

Now, things are starting to make sense 

Maybe there’s no good or bad 

Maybe there’s no perfect to uphold 

But you're struggling to understand the complexity of it all 

Without rules 

Without beliefs 

Who are you? 

What do you want? 

Who do you want to be? 

In this moment? 

When you've never recognized what you want to do 

That what you want is valid? 

And is exactly what you need to be doing? 

You never had strong desires, you say 

You could make do, anywhere, you say 

But what if you 

had infinite freedom 

what if you could be whoever you wanted to be? 

Where would you be? 

Would you be here, standing, sitting, exactly where you are? 

Hold on to that hope. 

That belief in yourself. 

You know what you're doing. 

You're fine. 

Everything's going to be okay.
