Dusty rose walls, halfway between earth and sky
Straw rafters overhead
Sunlight drifting in, beam by beam, lazily
The whispers of grey exhaust from motorbikes
Salaam aleikoum, kisses, love from brother to brother
Begging, needling, insulting, anything to sell
A little present for guiding you?
Ten dirhams? This is like ten cents.
Tiles of pavement, unsteady
A dip and a splash
Cats darting from car to wagon
Sun overhead, bearing down unbearable heat
Winds in the shade, cold as if evening has arrived
A wave of white at midday
Children, women, men
Men in hats, clapping a hand to each other's shoulders
A cafe, French, resplendent
Black and White and the red of riches pillowing the seats
A staircase winding above, to drink to your health and wealth in a foreign land
High above the dust of the streets
Streets of men, dusty, smoking, squatting, playing cards, whispering
Salaam aleikoum
High above the little boy and his brother
Biking in slipshod sandals
Next to the mopeds of grown men
Just another traveler
Three breads clutched loosely in one hand
Biking with just his knees to steer
