I was lying on a mat after a yoga class at Sacred Sounds Yoga. Savasana, corpse pose. It was the pose of relaxation and rest that, two years ago, I had scorned. I used to watch yoga videos online and as soon as the teacher called for Savasana (lying down on the floor), up I got.

Looking back, I had no idea how to relax.

But here I was, lying on a mat after a yoga class, closing my eyes. As I breathed, I heard a voice--an internal one, but one that sounded crystal clear--calling my name.

"Mona!"

It was my own voice. A Mona, calling me.

Then, in the span of a second, a thousand voices--all different, all of a timbre that I recognized as my own. "Mona! Mona. Monaaaa. Mona?"

"Mona" -- a single word, my name, a single moment, with a thousand echoes of a thousand voices, all in love and joy and excitement and respect and above all, love.
I felt tears coming to my eyes.

When did I last hear my name, said in such love? It was rare, and is still rare, for one to speak another's name directly to them; it is normally assumed. It was rare for me to notice my name being called; it is simply a reference or category, like how I call that book over there "book" -- but never Book, and never with such love.

I was happy. It was a gift. I spoke back to this magic, this underlying subconscious with so many inner voices and hidden memories -- who else have I heard call my name?
I heard a thousand voices, one after another. My mother, my father. Friends, family. I heard my name, again and again, in love. Some from memory, some as if they came from afar, some as if they came from something greater than memory.

I walked home that evening, but I do not have words for what I experienced. I found myself lost in time, and in possibility. It was as if everything were arrested, as if time stood still and my consciousness soared into every little thing--I noticed a golden leaf falling from the sky, and as it fell, I sensed an eternity in the moment. As I walked, I thought a thousand thoughts, I wove a thousand theories, I realized a thousand truths about myself and others, I wrote a thousand books and songs in my head -- all within the frame of one step, two steps, a breath, one more.

I almost wanted to laugh, because the truth of the matter was, although my mind (and body? and soul?) was swimming in a sea of possibility -- potential -- all I could do was take one step at a time. No books would be written as I walked, no matter how its chapters flashed into my mind.

I felt as though I was in the sands, utterly unable to build a sandcastle because I was one with every grain, lost in the multitudes. As I tried to put it down into writing, to build upon the sand, the sand shifted and I was shown even more.  There was one night in 2017 in which I was unable to speak a sentence. The moment a word left my lips, a thousand potentialities jumped to mind, and I could not pick. I was overwhelmed. My mind jumped from logic, to spirituality, to neurons, to who knows what else--and then, it passed. All of this happened in 2017. Infinity came and went, and came and went again.
During moments like those, I wanted to cry in joy and frustration and sheer wonder, because I had no idea that this was what life was all along -- something bigger than what we could ever hope to build, greater than the words I had in my vocabulary, an infinite pool of that which could be.

In moments like those, I had to learn to be kind. I had to learn to dip from the wellspring, and not get drowned. I had to learn how to hold grip on reality. When your brain decides to show you everything that could be, that is exactly when reality--that which is--teaches you a lesson. During that time, sometime in 2017, I lost my keys and wallet more times than I can count. I missed appointments. I reminded myself, when crossing the crosswalk, to remember what was at hand--that I could not go flying off into potential. I had to remember that, although potential is beautiful, I could only take one step at a time, speak one word at a time. That it would be a lifetime of building castles out of sand.
